 Statement from Real World
 With the rapid expansion of online retail, an efficient e-commerce system is essential for managing products,
 customer interactions, shopping carts, and order processing. A well-designed system should seamlessly han
dle product listings with attributes such as name, price, and stock availability, ensuring accurate inventory
 tracking. Customers should be able to browse available products, add or remove them from their shopping
 cart, and proceed with order placement while applying applicable discounts. Additionally, the system should
 facilitate smooth checkout, updating stock levels accordingly, and generate invoices upon successful transac
tions. The underlying implementation must support dynamic product updates, secure customer transactions,
 and an intuitive interface to enhance user experience.
 Analysis 1
 The task is to design and implement four classes—Product, Customer, ShoppingCart, and Order—that
 encapsulate these functionalities. The Product class should manage product details and stock control, the
 Customer class should facilitate adding products to the shopping cart, the ShoppingCart class should handle
 product addition/removal, discount applications, and provide a summary of selected items, and the Order
 class should manage order processing, ensuring successful transactions and stock updates.
 Analysis 2
 A well-designed e-commerce system should include the following components:
 • Products: Each product has a name, price, and stock availability. It supports adding/removing items
 and stock updates.
 • Customers: Each customer is identified by a name and maintains a shopping cart for purchases.
 • Shopping Carts: This component manages selected products, allows adding/removing items, applies
 discounts, and calculates total cost.
 • Orders: This component handles the final checkout process, updates stock, and confirms transactions.
